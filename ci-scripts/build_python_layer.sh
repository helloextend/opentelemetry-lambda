# This function removes the .dev suffix from version strings in the given directory.
# It is needed because how the releases are handled in the upstream repositories:
#   1. The work is done in the `main` branch. The packages in main are
#       versioned with the .dev suffix until a release is made. For instance,
#       `0.52b0.dev` is the version in `main`.
#   2. A release branch is created from `main` for each release. Commits from
#      the release branch are never merged back into `main`. If any changes are
#      needed in the release branch and in `main`, those commits are cherry-picked
#      from `main` into the release branch or the other way around.
#   3. The `.dev` suffix is removed from the version strings in the release branch.
#      For instance, if the version is `0.52b0.dev`, it is changed to `0.52b0`.
#   4. A release is made from the release branch.
#   5. The versions are updated in the `main` branch, keeping the `.dev` suffix. For instance,
#      if the version in `main` is `0.52b0.dev, after the release it will be 0.53b0.dev.
#
# Note this has some effects:
# - If we pull from the release branch into our fork, next time we pull from upstream it can
#   cause merge conflicts because the history of the branches are different.
# - If we try to build without removing the .dev suffix, we will get an error because
#   `<version>.dev` releases are not available via pip. We could install them from the folders
#   but it would involve some extra work because we also need to clone the core repo
#   and install the dependencies.
